  <h2 style="color:red;"> web </h2>
  <p>WEB is<u style="color:red;"> a computer programming system</u> created by Donald E.</p>
  <p> Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming":</p>
    <p> the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text,</p>
    <p>  rather than the reverse<strong> (as is common practice in most programming languages)</strong>,</p>
      <p> in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.</p>

<p>WEB consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source texts,</p>
  <p> and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX.</p>

  <p>CWEB is a version of WEB for the C programming language, while noweb is a separate literate programming tool,</p>
  <p> which is inspired by WEB (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic.</p>

  <p>The most significant programs written in WEB are TeX and Metafont.</p>
  <p> Modern TeX distributions use another program Web2C to convert WEB source to C.</p>
